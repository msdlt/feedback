								There are three steps to generating a list of the students who have saved or
								submitted a given survey and schedule:<br/><br/>
								<strong>Step 1:</strong> Choose the survey.<br/><br/>
								<strong>Step 2:</strong> Limit the results by choosing the particular schedule
									and/or submission dates that you are interested in. If you do not
									choose a schedule, the results will apply to all schedules of the
									chosen survey. You <strong>must</strong> check one or both of the 
									submission status check boxes. <strong>Saved</strong> indicates that
									the student has saved but not finally submitted the survey.<br/><br/>
								<strong>Step 3:</strong> Click the <strong>Show students</strong> button.<br/>
