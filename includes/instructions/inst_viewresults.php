								There are three steps to generating survey results:<br/><br/>
								<strong>Step 1:</strong> Choose the survey.<br/><br/>
								<strong>Step 2:</strong> Limit the results and create analysis criteria.<br/>
									<em>Limit the results</em> by choosing the particular schedule
									and/or submission dates that you are interested in. If you do not
									choose a schedule, the results will apply to all schedules of the
									chosen survey. You <strong>must</strong> check one or both of the 
									submission status check boxes. <strong>Saved</strong> indicates that
									the student has saved but not finally submitted the survey.<br/>
									<em>Analysis criteria</em> allow you to analyse the responses to one or more
									questions (<strong>Questions to be analysed</strong>)
									according to how the same students answered another question 
									(<strong>Question against which to analyse</strong>). To populate 
									<strong>Questions to be analysed</strong>, select one or more questions from
									<strong>Questions available for analysis</strong> and click the <strong>>></strong>
									button to transfer them. Multiple criteria can be
									created using the <strong>Add analysis criterion</strong> button but each question
									may only be analysed once.<br/><br/>
								<strong>Step 3:</strong> Choose whether to show results for items, questions, sections and 
								blocks that are hidden (this happens when you delete when results already exist) then choose 
								an output method and click the appropriate button. <br/>
