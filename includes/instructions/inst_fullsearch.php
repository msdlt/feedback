								There are three steps to searching for electives:<br/><br/>
								<strong>Step 1:</strong> Limit the electives searched to the last <em>n</em> years or 
								choose <em>All</em> to search all electives.<br/><br/>
								<strong>Step 2:</strong> Create search criteria.<br/>
									A search criterion allows you to search for feedback from respondents who answered a 
									question (<strong>Choose question to search by</strong>) in a particular way (<strong>Answer(s) to search by</strong>). For example, respondents who answered <em>Ghana</em> to 
									the question <em>Host country</em>. To populate <strong>Answer(s) to search for</strong>, select one or more questions from
									<strong>Choose answer(s) to search for</strong> and click the <strong>>></strong>
									button to transfer them. Multiple criteria can be
									created using the <strong>Add search criterion</strong> button but each question
									may only be searched by in one criterion. This allows you to search for e.g electives in 
									<em>Host country</em> = <em>Ghana</em> in institutions with <em>Investigative facilities 
									available</em> = <em>As would expect in UK DGH</em>.<br/><br/>
								<strong>Step 3:</strong> Click the <strong>Search</strong> button.<br/>
